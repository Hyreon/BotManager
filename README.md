# BotManager
A manager of Discord bots that I develop and manage. MaiDiscordBot is a personal bot for my friends' Discord guilds, Boteyy_ is for a YouTuber, SpeedrunBot is for the speedrunning community, GitManager is a bot to recreate a Scrum-like workboard with GitHub PR notifications in Discord, and 4 of the bots (BulletBot, Jigsaw, NSFWPolice, and Suggestion Box) are for another YouTuber's server.
